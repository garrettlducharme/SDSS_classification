# SDSS_classification
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has imaged approximately one-third of the night sky in five broad bands (ugriz). The entire survey contains over half a billion individual objects. In this project, we will use machine learning classification techniques in an attempt to classify stars, galaxies, and qasars from the survey. High performance classification techniques will be an important method for cataloguing the ever-growing databases of astronomical observations, especially with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope.

### Goals

The goal of this project will be to accurately classify small subset (10,000 observations) of the SDSS catalog containing stars, galaxies, and qasars. The data we will be using is mostly clean, but it will be important to correctly identify which features are relevant for modelling. We will start with basic models and then compare them to the state of the art techniques currently being used in the field of machine learning classification.
